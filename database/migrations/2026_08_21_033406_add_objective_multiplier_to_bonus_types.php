/**
 * Let a bonus_types row carry a multiplier instead of a point value.
 *
 * ARRL Field Day awards are additive point bonuses. Winter Field Day awards
 * "objectives", each worth an Objective Multiplier (OM) that is summed and
 * applied as `QSO points x (OM + 1)` — no points of their own. Both share the
 * same versioning, claim, proof and reconcile machinery, so they share the
 * table; only the value column differs.
 *
 * Null means "this award is scored in points" (every Field Day row).
