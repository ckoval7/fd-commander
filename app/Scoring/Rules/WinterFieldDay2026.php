/**
 * Winter Field Day Association 2026 rules.
 *
 * FROZEN. Do not modify this file after merge. Any WFDA 2027 rule change goes
 * into a new WinterFieldDay2027 class — see docs/scoring/adding-a-rules-version.md.
 *
 * Source: WFDA Standard Operating Procedure, https://winterfieldday.org/sop.php
 * (2026 edition).
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a {@see FieldDayRuleSet}.
 * WFD scores on a different model from ARRL Field Day:
 *
 *  - Score is `total QSO points x (OM + 1)`, not points plus additive bonuses.
 *  - Awards are "objectives", each worth an Objective Multiplier, not points.
 *  - There is no power multiplier; all stations are capped at 100 W PEP and
 *    running QRP is itself an objective.
 *  - There is no GOTA station, and no youth or emergency-power bonus.
